					<h2>How can creative coaching help you?</h2>
					<p class="emphasis">
						Making music is like a rollercoaster.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're like most music makers then you juggle a day job to pay the bills with production on the side. You're not alone! Many famous musicians have worked regular jobs well into their careers. Bloc Party's Kele was serving popcorn whilst he was featured in NME, and Ian Curtis of Joy Division clocked in as a civil servant between gigs.</p>
					<p class="emphasis">
						If this wasn't difficult enough, the creative process can throw everything up in the air. 
					</p>
					<p>
						How do you know what to write? How do you find a market for you music? Do your tracks sound good enough and is this even really worth pursuing? ... all these thoughts are enough to make you throw in the towel, especially in those dark periods where nothing seems to come our right - if at all.</p>
					<p class="emphasis">No matter what level you're at, the creative path is tough and lonely. </p>
				
					<p>
						But you don't have to face it on your own! Coaching gives you personal support to breakthrough all these blocks, get clarity and achieve your goals.
					</p>
					<p>As your coach, I will become your trusted friend who wants and expects the best and will challenge and inspire you to create at your peak. The techniques I use are based on the knowledge and strategies I’ve developed from helping producers all over the world and working at the heart of the music industry.

				<p class="font-weight-bold">Hi, I’m Marc and I've spent years working at the heart of the music industry with labels such as Island Records and Virgin/Emi.</p>

				<p>Since 2013 I've helped hundreds of producers to finish and release more music, meet collaborators, do their best creative work and get it signed.</p>

				<p>I've coached and run production camps at Tileyard Studios (home of The Prodigy, Mark Ronson, Chase & Status, Basement Jaxx & Sub Focus), Red Bull Studios, Pointblank and Peter Gabriel's RealWorld. My work has also been endorsed by Native Instruments, Focusrite-Novation, SoundCloud, Ninja Tune, Island Records, Axtone Records and many more</p>

				<p>As a producer myself, with music signed to Universal, I've felt what it's like to struggle on your own in one of the most competitive fields. There have never been so many musicians trying to make it as there are today. </p>

				<p class="font-weight-bold">How would it feel to have someone on your side, entirely focussed on your success and fullfillment</p>

				<p class="emphasis">Not necessarily.</p>
				<p>In the world of tennis, professional coach Nick Bollettieri has never been a better player than Andre Agassi or Venus & Serena Williams, but he’s outstanding at bringing out the best in these players and helping them achieve their peak results. </p>

				<p class="emphasis">That is the kind of value and expertise I will bring to your music and your life.</p>

				<p>Nonetheless, you can rest assured that I have a huge breadth of experience, including:</p>
