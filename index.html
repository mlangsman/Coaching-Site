					<h2>How can coaching help you?</h2>
					<p>
						Coaching gives you tailored, individual support to clarify and achieve your creative, personal and professional goals. As your coach, I will be your trusted friend who wants and expects the best and will challenge and inspire you to create at your peak.
					</p>
					<p>Over the course of six or twelve months, we'll work together towards creating the music and life you've always dreamed of. Whether you want to write an album, perform live, start your own music business or simply create the best work you're capable of then I'll be with you every step of your journey.</p>
					<p>
						The techniques I employ are based on the knowledge and strategies I’ve developed from helping producers all over the world and working at the heart of the music industry.

				<p>Hi, I’m Marc and since 2013 I've been coaching producers and running camps at the UK’s most exclusive music studios supported by Native Instruments, Focusrite-Novation, SoundCloud, Ninja Tune, Island Records, Axtone, Notting Hill Publishing and LANDR.</p>

				<p>I’ve spoken and taught at Brighton Music Conference as well as Red Bull, Real World and Tileyard Studios where I've helped hundreds of producers to finish more music, meet collaborators, do their best creative work and get it signed.</p>

				<p>As a producer myself, I've felt what it's like to struggle on your own in one of the most competitive fields. There have never been so many musicians trying to make it as there are today. How would it feel to have someone on your side, entirely focussed on your success and fullfillment?

				<p>Producer's who I coach also benefit from my experience working at Universal Music where I developed cutting-edge ways for artists and labels to stand out and profit in the digital economy.

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col copy-block your-coach global-padding">
				<h3 class="responsive-header">Am I a better producer than you?</h3>
				<p>Not necessarily.</p>
				<p>In the world of tennis, professional coach Nick Bollettieri has never been a better player than Andre Agassi or Venus & Serena Williams, but he’s outstanding at bringing out the best in these players and helping them achieve their peak results. </p>

				<p>That is the kind of value and expertise I will bring to your music and your life.</p>

				<p>Nonetheless, you can rest assured that I have a huge breadth of experience, including:</p>
