All too often we get distracted from making music by emails, facebook, instagram, youtube tutorials (and pretty much everything else on the internet).

Inspired by creative [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com) I’ve designed some wallpaper for your mobile lockscreen to remind to get down to your music, next time you’re tempted by distraction.

You can [download it here for iPhone 6/7](/assets/make-some-beats-instead-iphone.png). Other handsets coming soon :)
