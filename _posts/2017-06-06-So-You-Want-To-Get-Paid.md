One of the most common goals I hear from producers is the desire to earn a full-time living from their music. However, in most cases they haven’t laid out the specific details of what success looks like for them and what their plan is to achieve this. Does this sound like you?

Having a burning passion and ambition is great, but if you don’t know exactly what you’re shooting for, how are you going to score?

## Self-assesment

So let’s get some clarity on this for you right now. Grab a notebook and pen and take 10 minutes now to answer these questions:

- How much do you want to make a year from music?
- What’s the least you need a month to make music full-time?
- How will you earn it (gigs, recordings, merch, kickstarter, sync…)?
- When do you want to make it happen by?
- How will you know when you’re on the way to achieving this?
- What are you doing today to move forwards?  
	and lastly….  

- Why do you want to make money from your music?

This last one is a biggie, so if you only do one of these questions then please answer that.

## The big question

If you haven’t figured out exactly the reasons _why_ you’re shooting for your goal, then you may struggle to focus and follow through, particularly when the work isn’t flowing or you're getting rejected. 

For some it might be the chance to be free of a boring job and get creative every day. Or it could be to tour around the world and see different places, make thousands of people dance, become famous or simply just to work with other talented musicians. 

The [Artist Revenue Streams Data Portal][1] reports that of 4.5k musicians they surveyed, 33% were making a full time living with an average annual income of $35k. 

It’s not impossible to earn a living from music, but only a fraction actually achieve it. If you’re going to go all the way, then you have to challenge and stretch yourself even when you’ve lost all motivation. 

__When the going gets tough, the tough need serious reasons to keep going.__

This is one of the very first things I uncover when I’m coaching clients. 

## Seize the day
If you've done traditional goal setting before then you may have noticed that pinning all your hopes on a distant achievement does not make you satisfied today - it’s essential to have deeper qualities to connect to. 

For me personally, music making is about connection, which is one reason why I went to work in the audio and music industries and started running collaborative production camps. Working alone in my home studio and doing a boring day job just wasn’t meeting that need. 

So, I encourage you to go away and really think about not only what you want to achieve in more detail, but more importantly what’s driving you. Find out what your core values are and bring more of these into your life today and make the journey as enjoyable as the destination.
